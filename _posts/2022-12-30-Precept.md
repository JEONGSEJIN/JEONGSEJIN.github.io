1. Life is a series of Learning.  


2. Trials chase me because I can overcome them.  


Problem:  
When studying,  
1. can't concentrate,  
2. feeling unhappy,  
3. think that can never do anything with my own strength.  


My top-secret Solution:  
Go to the papers folder I have been saving for later, and look at the papers.  
This doing let me that think interested ideas and want to study again.  


Be careful of Cold~!  
Korea is Very Colllllld.  
Always be healthy!  
Bye~
